<p>The opening of the game is the beginning phase. It is when you are trying
		to control the centre of the board and get your chess pieces out from their
		starting positions to more aggressive posts. In his excellent book, The Ideas
		Behind the Chess Openings, Ruben Fine gives ten rules to bear in mind when
		starting a game of chess: </p>
<ol>
		<li>
				<p align="left">Open with either the e or d pawn - it is these pawns which
						stake a claim in the centre. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
				<p align="left">If possible try to develop your pieces so that they threaten
						something or make it difficult for your opponent	to develop. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
				<p align="left">It is generally a good idea to develop knights before bishops.
						This is because it is generally easier to see where your knights should
						go as they have less choice of good	squares than bishops. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
				<p align="left">When you develop your pieces do not move them to a square
						which can easily be attacked by your opponent and consequently drive your
						chessman to another square. Try to	move each piece only once	in the opening. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
				<p align="left">In the opening make only one or two pawn moves,	no more. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
				<p align="left">Do not bring your Queen out too early as it can be chased
						around the board by enemy pieces and you will lose valuable time and fall
						behind in development. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
				<p align="left">Bring your King to safety by castling as soon as possible
						and preferably on the king's side. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
				<p align="left">Play to get control of the centre of the chessboard. The
						centre consists of the squares d4, d5, e4 and e5. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
				<p align="left">Always try to keep at least one pawn in the centre of the
						chessboard. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
				<p align="left">Do not sacrifice (give away your pieces) without a good reason.
						For example, a good reason to sacrifice a pawn might be to get ahead on
						development, to prevent your opponent from castling, to build up a strong
						attack or to deflect your	opponent's Queen. </p>
		</li>
</ol>
<p>While it is normally a good idea to follow the above rules remember that there
		are always exceptions. However, there is always a good reason why a rule has
		been broken. Look at the following diagram:</p>
<p align="center"><img SRC="img/open1.gif" ALT="chessboard" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/> </p>
<p>Here White has not moved to d4 or e4 (see rule 1). However, the pawn on c4
		is attacking the centre square d5 (see rule 8). This pawn move is good. Compare
		this to the following diagram: </p>
<p align="center"><img SRC="img/open2.gif" ALT="chessboard" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/> </p>
<p>Here the pawn is having no effect at all on the centre. This move is not good!
		To summarise: In the opening: </p>
<p align="center">Control the centre<br></br>
		Develop your pieces<br></br>
		Castle as soon as possible </p>
<p>It is better for beginners to open a game with 1.e4 and to reply with 1...e5.
		This is because games of this nature lead to the more open games in which the
		pieces are developed quickly and play is more tactical. Consequently, the ideas
		are more easy to understand. </p>
