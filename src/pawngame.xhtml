<div align="left">Pelts and Alburt, in Comprehensive Chess Course, describe The Pawn
										Game. This game is very good for learning
		how pawns move. Remember the pawns move one square forward (never backward)
		except on their
										first move when they have a choice of
		moving either one or two squares. They capture by moving one square diagonally
		forward.

<p align="left"><strong>Choosing for colours </strong></p>
<p align="left">One of the players hides a Black pawn in one hand and a
        												White pawn in the other. She then holds out both fists in
        												front of her and the opponent selects one of them. The opponent
        												will play Black if the fist contains the Black pawn, and
        												he will play White if it contains the White pawn. After the
											first game	the players switch colours every game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </p>
