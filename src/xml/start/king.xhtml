        <p align="left">The King is the most important piece on the chessboard. It can
            never be captured and if it is in danger then it must be made safe immediately.
            If it is not possible to make the King safe then the game is lost. The King
            may move one square in any direction. In the diagram the King is able to move
            to one of the highlighted squares.</p>
        <p align="center"><img SRC="img/starters/kingb.gif" alt="kingb.gif (4623 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
        <p align="left">
            However, the King must never move on to a square that is being attacked
            by her opponents pieces. In the diagram the King cannot move onto the squares
            marked with a cross because the Black Bishop is attacking those squares. </p>
        <p align="center"><img SRC="img/starters/kingc.gif" alt="kingc.gif (4782 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
        <p align="left">If a piece is on a square that the King can move to then the
            King may capture that piece. In the diagram the King may capture the Rook </p>
        <p align="center"><img SRC="img/starters/kingd.gif" alt="kingd.gif (4417 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
        <p align="left">This position below is almost the same as in the diagram above.
            However, there is one very important difference. The Bishop is now protecting
            the Rook so that if the King captured the Rook the King would be attacked by
            the Bishop, we say the King would be in check, and Black would be able to capture
            the King on the next move. The King can never move himself into danger like
            this so he is unable to capture the Rook. </p>
        <p align="center"><img SRC="img/starters/kinge.gif" alt="kinge.gif (4584 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
        <p align="left">Consequently, because the King must never move on to a square
            that is being attacked by enemy pieces, two Kings can never stand next to each
            other on the chessboard. The position in this diagram is illegal. </p>
        <p align="center"><img SRC="img/starters/kingf.gif" alt="kingf.gif (4499 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
        <p align="left">Now you know how all of the chessmen move you can play chess
            with all of the pieces. Remember that the player with the White pieces always
            goes first. To decide who should play with the White pieces, one of the players
            hides a Black pawn in one hand and a white pawn in the other and holds out
            her fists in front of her. Her opponent chooses a hand and if the white pawn
            is in that hand then the opponent plays White. If it is a black pawn the opponent
            plays with the Black pieces. After the first game the players switch colours. </p>

        <p>As already mentioned, the King is invaluable. If it is attacked then it must
            move out of danger immediately and if it cannot be made safe then the game
            is lost. At the beginning of a chess game there is usually a battle for the
            centre of the board, therefore it is a good idea to move the King from the
            action to a safe place in the corner and to move the Rook to the middle of
            the board where	it can take part in the battle.	Castling allows you to do this.</p>
        <p>The chessboard can be divided vertically into two parts. Looking at the board
            from White's side, the left side we call the Queen's side and the right-side
            is the King's side. These terms are important because the King has a choice
            of which corner he goes to; he can castle to the King's side or to the Queen's
            side. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="img/side.gif" alt="side.gif (7419 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/> </p>
        <p align="left">When the King castles, he moves two squares to the left or right
            and the Rook is moved to stand on the opposite side of the King. When castling,
            the King must always be moved first otherwise your opponent could claim that
            you have moved the Rook instead of castling! In the diagram below neither Kings
            have castled	yet. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="img/castle1.gif" alt="castle1.gif (6709 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/> </p>
        <p align="left">In the diagram below the White King has castled King's side or
            castled short. It has moved two squares to the right and the Rook has come
            to stand on the square immediately next to the King on its opposite side. This
            way of castling is written O-O. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="img/castle2.gif" alt="castle2.gif (6697 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/> </p>
        <p align="left">In the next diagram the White King has castled Queen's side or
            castled long. Again it has moved two squares but this time it has moved to
            the left and the Rook has come to stand on the square immediately next to the
            King on his opposite side. This	way of castling is written O-O-O. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="img/castle3.gif" alt="castle3.gif (6562 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/> </p>
        <p align="left">There are certain conditions which prevent either player from
            castling: </p>

                        castled on the King's side. Consequently the White King would be in check.
                        However, White can castle on the Queen's side and perhaps later she could
                        castle	on the King's side.</p>

        <p align="left">It is generally a good idea to castle early in the game to get
            the King to safety before attacking and opening up lines in the centre. Remember
            - those lines could lead directly to your king and leave it open to attack
            by your opponent!</p>
