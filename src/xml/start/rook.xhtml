        <p align="left">The Rook moves horizontally and vertically any number of squares,
            forwards or backwards. In the diagram the Rook can move to any of the highlighted
            squares. </p>

        <p align="left">In this diagram the Rook now has less choice of squares to which
            it can move because the other White pieces block its path. It can now only
            move to the highlighted squares. </p>

        <p align="left">If an enemy piece is standing on a square to which the Rook can
            move, it can be captured. In the next diagram, White is able to capture the
            Bishop with her Rook. She does this by removing the Bishop from the board and
            placing the Rook on that square instead. </p>

        <p>As already mentioned, the King is invaluable. If it is attacked then it must
            move out of danger immediately and if it cannot be made safe then the game
            is lost. At the beginning of a chess game there is usually a battle for the
            centre of the board, therefore it is a good idea to move the King from the
            action to a safe place in the corner and to move the Rook to the middle of
            the board where it can take part in the battle. Castling allows you to do this.</p>
        <p>The chessboard can be divided vertically into two parts. Looking at the board
            from White's side, the left side we call the Queen's side and the right-side
            is the King's side. These terms are important because the King has a choice
            of which corner he goes to; he can castle to the King's side or to the Queen's
            side. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="img/side.gif" alt="side.gif (7419 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
        <p align="left">When the King castles, he moves two squares to the left or right
            and the Rook is moved to stand on the opposite side of the King. When castling,
            the King must always be moved first otherwise your opponent could claim that
            you have moved the Rook instead of castling! In the diagram below neither Kings
            have castled yet. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="img/castle1.gif" alt="castle1.gif (6709 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
        <p align="left">In the diagram below the White King has castled King's side or
            castled short. It has moved two squares to the right and the Rook has come
            to stand on the square immediately next to the King on its opposite side. This
            way of castling is written O-O. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="img/castle2.gif" alt="castle2.gif (6697 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
        <p align="left">In the next diagram the White King has castled Queen's side or
            castled long. Again it has moved two squares but this time it has moved to
            the left and the Rook has come to stand on the square immediately next to the
            King on his opposite side. This way of castling is written O-O-O. </p>
