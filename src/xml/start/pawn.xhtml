    <p>The pawn seems, to the beginner, to be rather insignificant. After all, it
        is worth only 1 point, the least of any of the other chessmen. However, pawns
        can be very important as you will come to appreciate. </p>
    <p>At the beginning of the game each side has 8 pawns. Except on its first move,
        a pawn may only move one square forward at a time. Pawns can never move backwards.
        When a pawn makes its very first move it has a choice; it can either move one
        square or two. However, it moves one square in all following moves. </p>
    <p align="center"><img SRC="img/starters/pawnb.gif" ALT="Chess board" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
    <p align="left">If the square immediately in front of the pawn contains another
        piece then the pawn is unable to move forward. It is blocked. None of the pawns
        in this diagram can move. </p>
    <p align="center"><img SRC="img/starters/pawnd.gif" ALT="Blocked pawns" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
    <p align="left">Although a pawn moves straight forward it captures by talking
        one square diagonally forward. In the diagram White can capture either the
        Rook or the Knight. She does this by removing the captured piece from the board
        and replacing it with the pawn. </p>
    <p align="center"><img SRC="img/starters/pawnc.gif" ALT="Chess board" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
    <p align="left">This diagram shows the position after the pawn has captured the
        Rook.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="img/starters/pawne.gif" alt="pawne.gif (4491 bytes)" WIDTH="291" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
    <p align="left">When a pawn reaches the other end of the board it can be changed
        for any other piece of its own colour, except the King. This is called promotion.
        Therefore, a pawn can be promoted to a Queen, a Rook, a Bishop or a Knight.
        Normally a pawn is promoted to a Queen but sometimes there may be a good reason
        to promote a pawn to another piece instead. If there is not a spare Queen,
        a Rook turned upside down (or any other suitable object) is place on the board
        to represent a Queen . A pawn is promoted by removing the pawn from the board
        and placing the chosen piece on the promotion square.</p>

        <h3 align="center">The En Passant Pawn Capture</h3>
        <p align="left">Every pawn, on its first move, has the choice of moving either
            one or two squares forward. </p>
        <p align="left">Look at this diagram.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="img/pass1.gif" alt="pass1.gif (5512 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="290"/></p>
        <p align="left">Black may think, &quot;If I move my pawn one square White will
            capture it so I'll move it two squares.&quot; and the position would be as
            shown in the diagram below:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="img/pass2.gif" alt="pass2.gif (5546 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
        <p align="left">However, White can still take the Black pawn as if it had moved
            only one square.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="img/pass3.gif" alt="pass3.gif (5641 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
        <p align="left">The new position would be as shown in the diagram below. White
            removes the black pawn from the board and places the White pawn on the square
            the Black pawn would have moved to if	it had only moved	one square forward.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="img/pass4.gif" alt="pass4.gif (5423 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
        <p align="left">This special way of capturing is called capturing en passant
            and is abbreviated e.p. En passant is a French expression	which means &quot;in
            passing&quot; The en passant capture must be done immediately after the black
            pawn advances two squares. If White plays another move she cannot then decide
            to capture en passant!</p>
