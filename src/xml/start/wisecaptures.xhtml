<p>From the table you can see that the Queen is worth 9 points and the pawn is
		worth 1 point. This tells us that the Queen is more important than a pawn.
		The Bishops and Knights are worth 3 points but it is generally considered that
		the Bishops are worth slightly more than the Knights. However, it depends upon
		the position on the board. In positions where the centre is blocked by pawns,
		Knights (that can jump over these pawns) can be better than Bishops that need
		open diagonals to function efficiently. </p>
<p>In the diagram below, White is able to capture either the Queen or the Bishop
		with her Rook. The Queen is worth 9 points and the Bishop is worth 3 points.
		Therefore, it would be better if White captured the Queen because the Queen
		is more valuable than the Bishop.</p>
<p align="center"><img SRC="img/cap1.gif" ALT="Rook captures" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
<p align="left">In the following diagram the Knight is able to capture the Bishop
		or the Rook. If White captures either piece the Knight will be recaptured with
		a pawn. Is it still a good idea to capture one of the pieces? If White captures
		the Bishop she will lose her Knight. Therefore, she will have gained 3 points
		and lost 3 points. It would be an equal exchange. Nobody has gained anything.
		However, if White captures the Rook she will gain 5 points and only lose 3
		points so capturing the Rook	is	a good exchange!</p>
<p align="center"><img SRC="img/cap2.gif" ALT="Knight captures" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
<p align="left">Now let's look at the following diagram:</p>
<p align="center">
        		<img SRC="img/cap3.gif" HEIGHT="293" WIDTH="291" ALT="chessboard"/> </p>
<p>Should White capture the Black Knight? If the White Knight captured the Black
		Knight the black pawn could take the White Knight and it would be an equal
		exchanged. However, let's look at little closer at the position. The Black
		Knight is being attacked by White's Knight, Bishop, Queen and Rook. Thus it
		is being attacked four times. It is being defended three times by the Black
		pawn, Bishop and Queen. White can win a pawn by playing 1.Nxd5 cxd5 2.Bxd5
		Bxd5 3.Qxd5 Qxd5 4.Rxd5. It is generally a good idea to capture with the piece
		of smallest value first. If White had played 1.Qxd5 Black could answer with
		1...cxd5 2.Nxd5 and Black need not continue to exchange pieces. White has lost
		a Queen and only gained a Knight and	a pawn. This is not good! </p>
<p align="left">Counting how many times a piece is attacked and defended is a
		good way of working out whether captures are wise. If a piece is attacked more
		times than it is defended, it is possible that you will gain something by capturing
		it. When you attack something with the same or fewer number of pieces you will
		not gain anything. When applying this rule you must also remember the value
		of the pieces. It would not be	good	to win a Knight and a pawn for a Queen! </p>
<p align="left">In the next diagram, the White Knight is attacking the pawn on
		e5 but it is being defended by the Knight on c6. White can still win the pawn
		by capturing the defending Knight. 1.Bxc6 dxc6 2.Nxe5 wins	a	pawn. </p>

<h3 align="center">Some good advice about exchanging chess pieces</h3>
<ul>
		<li>Exchange pieces if by doing so you gain material. As little as an extra
		pawn can lead to a won game.</li>
        <li>When you have more material than your opponent, exchange pieces not
        		pawns. When there are lots of pieces on the board the effects of your
        		extra piece will not be felt as much. International Grandmaster Arthur
        		Bisguier gives a	graphical explanation. He says, &quot;It's sort of
        		like basketball or soccer: five players will sometimes have trouble
        		scoring against four opposing players, but take away three from each
        		side and the stronger team will find it easier to score with two players
   		against one.&quot; </li>
        <li>When you have less material than your opponent, exchange pawns not
        		pieces. If your opponent has a Knight and pawns she will try to promote
        		a pawn as she can not checkmate with only a Knight. If she has only
   		a Knight and no pawns the	game is drawn!</li>
        <li>When you are under severe attack exchange pieces. To quote Bisguier
        		again, &quot;The fewer men each player has, the weaker the attacking
        		player's threats become, and the easier it is for the defending side
   		to meet these threats.&quot;</li>
        <li>If you have a cramped position where your pieces do not have much
        		room for movement it is a good idea to exchange pieces. Exchange some
   		of them and the others will have more	room to move!</li>
        <li>Exchange pieces if you weaken your opponents pawn structure by doing
   		so.</li>
</ul>
