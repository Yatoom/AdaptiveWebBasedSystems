    <p align="left">The Bishop moves diagonally any number of squares, forwards or
        backwards. The diagram below shows all the possible squares to which the bishop
        may move. Each side has two bishops; one bishop moves along the light coloured
        squares and the other bishop moves along the dark coloured squares.</p>

    <p align="left">The Bishop's path can be blocked by other pieces on the chessboard.
        In the diagram below the Bishop now has less choice of squares to which it
        can move because the other White pieces block its path.</p>

    <p align="left">In the diagram below the White Bishop is able to capture the
        Rook. She does this by removing the Rook from the board and placing her Bishop
        in its place.</p>

        the Rook.</p>
