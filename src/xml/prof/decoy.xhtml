        <p>A decoy occurs when a piece is decoyed onto a fatal square.</p>

        <p>Let's look at the following example:</p>

        <img src="http://www.chesscorner.com/tutorial/tactics/decoy/decoy1.gif" />

        <p>White plays 1. Bxf7+  decoying the Black King and  after 1...Kxf7 2.Qxd8 wins the Black Queen!</p>

        <p>Decoys are often used with other tactics such as knight forks as in the following example:</p>

        <img src="http://www.chesscorner.com/tutorial/tactics/decoy/decoy3.gif" />

        <p>Black wins by playing 1...Rh1+ (decoying the King) 2.Kxh1 Nxg3+ (Forking King and Queen) 3.Kg2 Nxh5</p>

        <p>Decoys are also often seen with checkmate in mind as in the example below. Can you see how White achieves checkmate using a decoy?</p>

        <img src="http://www.chesscorner.com/tutorial/tactics/decoy/decoy2.gif"/>

        <p>White decoys the King with 1.Qd8+ and then after 1...Kxd8 there follows 2.Bg5 Ke8 3.Rd8# (or 2...Kc7 3.Bd8#)</p>
