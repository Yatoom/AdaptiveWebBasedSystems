        <p>In the opening phase of the game it is important to develop your pieces quickly to active squares on the chess board. This means that it is seldom a good idea to move the same piece twice before all other pieces have been developed and unnecessary pawn moves should be avoided. It is also important to claim your share of the centre of the board. This makes it easier for your army to manoeuvre.</p>
