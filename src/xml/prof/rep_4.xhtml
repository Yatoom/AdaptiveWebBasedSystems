        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>The Nimzo-indian is Aron Nimzowitsch's greatest contributory system to modern opening theory.</p>

        <p>It is one of the most popular defences to 1.d4. It often features black trying to saddle white with doubled pawns and then use the higher level Nimzowitsch strategies of Restraint and Blockade to remove White's counterplay and exploit white's structural weaknesses. Black makes the concession of giving up the dark squared bishop, hoping that the position will remain closed enough for his knights to be equal or more effective than the White bishops.</p>

        <p>White's implicit plans with consideration to having the two bishops and possible structural damage on the queenside are generally:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>To open up the position for the two bishops</li>

            <li>To launch an attack on the black king, to decide the issue before structural weaknesses are emphasised in the endgame</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Starting Position</h3>

        <img src="http://www.chesscorner.com/tutorial/Intermediate/openingrep/nimzo/startpos.gif" />

        <p>This move which signals the start of the Rubinstein variation is the main line of the Nimzo-Indian. White leaves the bishop on c1 at home and prepares development of his kingside pieces. Rubinstein was one of the worlds best four players from about 1907 to 1922 (See Lasker in culture section).</p>

        <p>The first game of the Rubinstein variation was when Rubinstein introduced it against Alekhine in the St Petersburg tournament, 1914:</p>

        <p>Rubinstein Akiba - Alekhine Alexander [E43]<br />
            St Petersburg-1</p>

        <p>1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.f3 c5 7.a3 Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 d5 9.Ne2 0-0 10.0-0 Nbd7 11.Ng3 Qc7 12.cxd5 exd5 13.e4 cxd4 14.cxd4 Qc3 15.Be3 dxe4 16.fxe4 Ba6 17.Bxa6 Qxe3+ 18.Kh1 Nxe4 19.Nf5 Nf2+ 20.Rxf2 Qxf2 21.Qg4 g6 22.Rf1 Qb2 23.Nh6+ Kg7 24.Nxf7 Qb3 25.d5 Nf6 26.Qd4 Rxf7 27.Bc4 Qa4 28.g4 Rc8 0-1</p>

        <p>Since (or despite :-) this game, this 4th move has become one of the most popular methods against the Nimzo-indian defence.</p>

        <p>Black has a number of alternatives here :-</p>

        <p>This paper looks at the following 3 alternatives and more importantly tries to focus on</p>

        <p>the ideas and concepts that they represent. It is too easy to drown in variations presented in standard "cop-out" opening books/ encyclopaedias. If you like being drowned in a sea of variations/ past games, then you can view all the games in this technical paper's appendices without trying to figure out the higher level template plans!</p>

        <h4>Introduction to 4..c5</h4>

        <p>4... c5 is referred to as the Huebner variation. Black often tries simply to double White's pawns and then use a blockading strategy by later playing d6.</p>

        <p>The following game by Kasparov shows the use of the unusual Nge2 to combat c5. This shall form this technical paper's stem game for an anti 4..c5 system. Kasparov's plan was highly effective. It basically involved flinging his kingside pawns against Csom in a controlled aggressive way! Csom's Bf5 did not help his cause, because it enabled Kasparov to gain some extra time for this plan.</p>

            Baku, 1980</p>

        <p>5.Nge2 (! from the perspective of this technical paper)</p>

        <p>(It is interesting how certain chess literature downplays  moves with apparent concrete evidence. For example Ludek Pachman in "The Openings Game" claims that this move does not promise much and gives 5... cxd4 6 exd4 d5 7 a3 Be7 c5 0-0! b4 b6 10 g3 bxc5 11 dxc5 a5 12 Rb1 axb4 13 axb4 Nc6 and "Black's centre pawns are stronger than White's wing pawns").</p>

        <p>True, this is not the more standard looking knight move 5. Nf3 or 5.Bd3. White does however prevent black from doubling the pawns, and then using a blockading strategy. An example from the doubled pawns Nimzowitsch paper on BCC on-line duplicated here for convenience is :-</p>

        <p>Iohner P - Nimzowitsch Aaron [E50]<br />
            It, Dresden, 1926</p>

        <p>1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 0-0 5.Bd3 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.0-0 Bxc3 8.bxc3 d6 9.Nd2 b6 10.Nb3 e5 11.f4 e4 12.Be2 Qd7 13.h3 Ne7 14.Qe1 h5 15.Bd2 Qf5 16.Kh2 Qh7 17.a4 Nf5 18.g3 a5 19.Rg1 Nh6 20.Bf1 Bd7 21.Bc1 Rac8 22.d5 Kh8 23.Nd2 Rg8 24.Bg2 g5 25.Nf1 Rg7 26.Ra2 Nf5 27.Bh1 Rcg8 28.Qd1 gxf4 29.exf4 Bc8 30.Qb3 Ba6 31.Re2 Nh4 32.Re3 Bc8 33.Qc2 Bxh3 34.Bxe4 Bf5 35.Bxf5 Nxf5 36.Re2 h4 37.Rgg2 hxg3+ 38.Kg1 Qh3 39.Ne3 Nh4 40.Kf1 Re8 0-1</p>

        <p>You can see from the above game that White's counterplay was considerably reduced by the master Nimzowitsch. White played passively, and Black's moves reflected deep concepts of Overprotection, blockade and restraint.</p>

        <p>cxd4</p>

        <img src="img/prof/nimzo3.png" />

        <p>6.exd4 0-0 (6..d5 is arguably a more standard move in this position. Csom allows Kasparov to play d5.)</p>

        <p>7.a3 Be7</p>

        <img src="img/prof/nimzo2.png" />


        <p>8.d5 exd5 9.cxd5 Re8 10.g3 Bc5 11.Bg2 d6</p>

        <p>12.h3(!)</p>

        <p>This move allows Kasparov to play aggressively with g4 and g5 later!</p>

        <p>Bf5</p>

        <p>Bf5?!</p>

        <p>This move may have accelerated White's initiative. Chandler-Andersson(1980) saw 12...a6 with the game following 13 0-0 Nbd7 14 Nd4 Ne5 and black had good play after Bd7.</p>

        <p>13.0-0 Nbd7 14.g4 Be4 15.Ng3 Bxg2 16.Kxg2 Nf8 17.g5</p>

        <img src="img/prof/nimzo1.png" />
        <p>17...N6d7 18.h4 Ne5 19.h5 f6 20.Nce4 fxg5 21.Bxg5 Qb6 22.h6 Nf7 23.hxg7 Nd7 24.Nf6+ Nxf6 25.Bxf6 Qb5 26.Rh1 Bb6 27.Qf3 Ne5 28.Nf5 Nf7 29.Rxh7 Kxh7 30.Rh1+ Kg8 31.Rh8+ Nxh8 32.gxh8Q+ Kf7 33.Qfh5# 1-0</p>
        <h3>Conclusions</h3>

        <p>4.e3, the start of the Rubinstein variation is a simple and effective move. It can be combined with the follow up ideas of Ne2, f3 and later advances either in the centre or on the kingside. It is a promising aggressive system to play against the Nimzo-indian defence and has been played with success by the top Grandmasters including Gary Kasparov, the current world champion.</p>
