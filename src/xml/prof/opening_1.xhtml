        <p>The Benko gambit is one of the most well respected gambits against d4. Black's counterplay is very durable compared to many other gambits, in that the queenside pressure can last well into the endgame. There are several plans however at White's disposal to combat this gambit, the most radical being to simply countergambit with b6 (after cxb6 a6 b6!?).</p>
