        <p>Sometimes a chess piece is overloaded by having more than one defensive job to do. The overworked piece can be exploited by capturing one of the pieces it is defending or occupying a square it is defending forcing it to leave its other defensive job.</p>

        <p>In the diagram below, the Black Rook is overloaded. It is defending the Bishop and the Knight. How can White exploit this unfortunate position?</p>

        <p>White wins a piece by playing: 1.Bxd3 and after 1...Rxd3 is a piece ahead after 2.Rxb7</p>

        <p>In the diagram below can you see which of Black's pieces is overloaded and how White took advantage of it?</p>
