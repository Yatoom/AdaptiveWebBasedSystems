        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>This paper focuses on the counter pawn sacrifice line, b6, which occurs after d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5 4.cxb5 a6 5.b6. In particular it examines ways in which white can simultaneously reduce Black's queenside counterplay and get in the effective attacking breakthrough of e4-e5.</p>
        <h3>Starting Position</h3>
        <img src="http://www.chesscorner.com/tutorial/Intermediate/openingrep/benko/startbenko.gif" />
        <p>This system has been popularised by leading grandmasters such as Shirov. It has been given only short coverage in books dedicated to the benko gambit such as "Benko Gambit" by Gufeld (Batsford, 1988) where the strategic point of b6 is summed up as white wanting to use c4 for his pieces. This does not do very much justice to this line.</p>

        <p>Examining the pawn structure implications of this line reveals some interesting insight.</p>

        <p>Black has an interesting immediate a5 with the intention of stopping white from castling kingside normally. White however can take advantage of quick piece development and there are a couple of miniatures that demonstrate this.</p>

        <p>Black may also do an immediate recapture with the queen or, alternatively may want to take the pawn at leisure and have the option of re-capturing the b6 pawn with a different piece. The main methods of delaying include a delayed capture on b6 with the queen; black doing Nb8-d7xb6, or playing an immediate a5.</p>

        <p>In these events, white could turn his strategy into a counterplay-destroying style strategy implemented via attempting an a4-a5 manoever. This would clamp down on the sensitive b6 square. In this strategy if Black allows a4-a5 by White, there have been some interesting white victories.</p>

        <p>If Black plays e6 then this has led to some very wild games.</p>
        <h3>Conclusions</h3>

        <p>The surprise counter gambit b6 is an effective weapon against the benko gambit, which offers white effective strategic plans such as Nf3-d2-c4, and a4-a5 in some variations. Strong grandmasters such as Shirov are pioneering this line with success which is evidence of its soundness.</p>
