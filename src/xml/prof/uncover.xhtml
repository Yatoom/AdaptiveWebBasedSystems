        <p>A discovered attack occurs when a piece moves and in doing so it uncovers an attack on an enemy piece.</p>
        <p>Look at the following diagrams:</p>
        <img src="http://www.chesscorner.com/tutorial/tactics/discovered/discovered6.gif" /> 
        <p>The white king moves to d2 uncovering an attack by the queen.</p>

        <p>In the following diagram, White is able to win the black queen. Can you see how?</p>
        <img src="http://www.chesscorner.com/tutorial/tactics/discovered/discovered1.gif" /> 
        <p>Yes, 16.Bxh7+. The new position is shown in the diagram below.</p>

        <p>After 16...Kxh7 White plays 17.Qxd4 and the black queen is lost!</p>
        <p>If a discovered attack gives check to the enemy King it is known as a discovered check. This form of attack can be especially dangerous.</p>
        <p>In the diagram below Black is able to use a discovered check to win the white queen. Can you see how?</p>
        <img src="http://www.chesscorner.com/tutorial/tactics/discovered/discovered3.gif" /> 
        <p>The black pawn moves to d4 attacking the white queen and allowing the bishop to  check the king. White can only deal with one of these threats at a time and, because of the priority of check (if the king is in check it must be made safe immediately), she must lose her queen.   </p>
