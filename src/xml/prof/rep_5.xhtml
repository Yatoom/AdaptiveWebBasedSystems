        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>This opening paper focuses on an agressive attacking line against the Queens Gambit declined which is generally regarded as a very solid opening. This line has been played by grandmasters such as Shirov, Petrosian, Ward.</p>

        <p>This variation of the Queens Gambit exchange variation can be reached by the following moves:-</p>

        <p>1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Bg5 Be7 6.e3 c6 7.Bd3 Nbd7 8.Qc2 0-0 9.Nge2 Re8 10.0-0-0</p>

        <p>White is generally playing for an attack against Black's king, and at the same time trying to make sure black's counterplay does not get of control, with moves like b5 coming at white's king.</p>

        <p>One example game, where white uses the c5 square to remove counterplay before continuing with his king side attack is the following:-</p>
