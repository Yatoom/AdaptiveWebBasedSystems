<p align="left">Chess is a very old game. People believe that it originated in
		India in the fourth or fifth century but no one really knows who invented it.
		Chess is an intellectual competition between two players and is a very logical
		game where luck plays little part. The winner is the person who solves the
		puzzles on the chess	board better than her opponent.</p>
<p align="left">The game is played on a squared board divided into 64 squares,
		alternating from light to dark. The board is always set up so that each player
		has the light square on her right-hand side. (Remember: light on the right).
		The Queen always stands on the square of her own colour. Thus, the light coloured
		Queen must stand on the light coloured square. A good way of remembering this
		is the saying: The Queen is a fashionable lady. She likes her dress to match
		her shoes! </p>

<h2 align="center">The Chessmen</h2>
<p align="left">The pieces and pawns are called chessmen. They have different
		points to indicate how valuable they are. A Queen is worth 9 points so she
		is far more valuable than a pawn which is only worth 1 point. The King can
		never be captured and if he is in danger then he must move to a safe place
		or another chessman must make him safe. If he can not reach safety then the
		game is	lost. The person with the White pieces always	begins the game. </p>
<p align="left">The table below shows how the chessmen are represented in printed
		material, the symbol given to it and its value.</p>
