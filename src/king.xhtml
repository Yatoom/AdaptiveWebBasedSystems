        <p align="left">The King is the most important piece on the chessboard. It can
            never be captured and if it is in danger then it must be made safe immediately.
            If it is not possible to make the King safe then the game is lost. The King
            may move one square in any direction. In the diagram the King is able to move
            to one of the highlighted squares.</p>

        <p align="left">
            However, the King must never move on to a square that is being attacked
            by her opponents pieces. In the diagram the King cannot move onto the squares
            marked with a cross because the Black Bishop is attacking those squares. </p>
        <p align="center"><img SRC="img/kingc.gif" alt="kingc.gif (4782 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
        <p align="left">If a piece is on a square that the King can move to then the
            King may capture that piece. In the diagram the King may capture the Rook </p>
        <p align="center"><img SRC="img/kingd.gif" alt="kingd.gif (4417 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
        <p align="left">This position below is almost the same as in the diagram above.
            However, there is one very important difference. The Bishop is now protecting
            the Rook so that if the King captured the Rook the King would be attacked by
            the Bishop, we say the King would be in check, and Black would be able to capture
            the King on the next move. The King can never move himself into danger like
            this so he is unable to capture the Rook. </p>
        <p align="center"><img SRC="img/kinge.gif" alt="kinge.gif (4584 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
        <p align="left">Consequently, because the King must never move on to a square
            that is being attacked by enemy pieces, two Kings can never stand next to each
            other on the chessboard. The position in this diagram is illegal. </p>

        <p align="left">Now you know how all of the chessmen move you can play chess
            with all of the pieces. Remember that the player with the White pieces always
            goes first. To decide who should play with the White pieces, one of the players
            hides a Black pawn in one hand and a white pawn in the other and holds out
            her fists in front of her. Her opponent chooses a hand and if the white pawn
            is in that hand then the opponent plays White. If it is a black pawn the opponent
            plays with the Black pieces. After the first game the players switch colours. </p>
