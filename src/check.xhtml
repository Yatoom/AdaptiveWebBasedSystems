		<h2>Check</h2>
<p align="left">When the King is being attacked directly by an opponent's piece
		we say that the King is in check. In the diagram the Black King is being checked
		by the White Bishop.</p>
<p align="center"><img SRC="img/checka.gif" alt="checka.gif (6405 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
<p align="left">If the King is in check it must be made safe immediately.</p>
<p align="left">There are three ways to get out of check:</p>
<blockquote>
		<p align="left">1. The King may move to a square which is not being attacked
				by an enemy piece.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
		<p align="left">In the diagram below the King has moved out of	check.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img SRC="img/checkb.gif" alt="checkb.gif (6211 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
<blockquote>
		<p align="left">2. A piece may be moved in between the King and the enemy piece
				to block the check. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
		<p align="left">In this diagram the Black Bishop blocks the check with her
				Bishop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img SRC="img/checkc.gif" alt="checkc.gif (6183 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
<blockquote>
		<p align="left">3. The piece that is attacking the King can be	captured. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
		<p align="left">In this diagram the Bishop can be captured by the	Black	Rook. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img SRC="img/checkd.gif" alt="checkd.gif (6223 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
<p align="left">This is the new position after the Rook has made its capture.
		The King is no longer in check! </p>
<p align="center"><img SRC="img/checke.gif" alt="checke.gif (6054 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
<h2 align="center">Checkmate </h2>
<p align="left">If the King is in check and cannot get out of check then we say
		the King is checkmated and the game is lost.</p>
<p align="left">In the diagram below, the White Queen checks the	Black King. </p>
<p align="center"><img SRC="img/checkf.gif" alt="checkf.gif (6313 bytes)" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/></p>
<p align="left">Black is not able to do any of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
		<p align="left">1. move to a square which is not being attacked by an enemy
				piece.
				2. move a piece between the King and the enemy piece to block
				the check.
				3. capture the attacking piece.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">so Black is checkmated and has lost the game! </p>


		<h1 align="center">How Games are Drawn</h1>
		<p align="center"><img SRC="img/chgame.gif" alt="chgame.gif (2835 bytes)" WIDTH="156" HEIGHT="115"/></p>
		<p align="left">There are six ways to draw a game of chess: </p>
		<p>1. Perpetual Check - If an opponent checks the enemy King repeatedly we call
			this perpetual check. Perpetual check is usually used by the weaker side to
			avoid losing the game. In the diagram below White is ahead on material and
			is threatening checkmate by moving	the Queen to g7. </p>
		<p align="center"><img SRC="img/draw1.gif" ALT="Draw" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/> 
			Black has a saving series of moves which give perpetual check:
			1. Kh1 Qf1+
			2. Kh2 Qf2+
			3. Kh1 Qf1+
			4. Kh2 Qf2+
			
		</p>
		<p>There is no way White can avoid Black from checking her King so the game is
			a draw.</p>
		<p>2. Stalemate - If the King is not in check but it is unable to move to a safe
			square we say that the King is stalemated and the game is drawn. Many beginners
			who are ahead on material mistakenly stalemate the enemy king. Beware! In the
			diagram below the White King is not in check but it has no safe squares to
			go to so the	game is a draw.</p>
		<p align="center"><img SRC="img/draw2.gif" ALT="Draw" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="291"/> </p>
		<p align="left">3. Insufficient mating material - When neither side has enough
			pieces on the board to checkmate the enemy king then the game is drawn. It
			is impossible to checkmate with: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Just the two Kings on the board. </li>
			<li>King and Bishop against a King </li>
			<li>King and Knight against a King </li>
			<li>King and two Knights against a King </li>
		</ol>
		<p>4. Repetition of moves - If the same position occurs three times in a game
			then a player may claim a draw. The perpetual check position above is also
			a draw because the same position occurs three	times. </p>
		<p>5. Fifty move rule - If both sides have made 50 consecutive moves without
			making a capture or pawn move then a player may claim a	draw. </p>
		<p>6. Draw by agreement - Both players may feel that the position on the board
			is equal and consequently agree to a draw. Many Grandmaster games end in a
			draw in this way. </p>
